# ReactWeatherApp
We have done a weather app with OpenWeatherMap api in React and TypeScript.
When you write a city name into the first input field you get an API callback with weather information for the next seven days.
On show more you can get more detailed information about that day. 

In the second input field it's possible to save a city in LS. 
When you press contact us you get a form that's done with Formik that you can enter your name and some content into. 

We have also used React-Router to change the URL for the different pages. We have used State in Api, localstorage and TodaysDate.
